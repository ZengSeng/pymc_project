# 🔍 Bayesian Data Analysis with PyMC 🏦🏭

Welcome to your PyMC playground! This project combines Bayesian statistics with practical applications in finance and manufacturing. Get ready to impute missing data, build GLMs, and tackle real-world problems with probabilistic programming.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Navigate to your project:
   cd c:\repo\pymc_project
   
   Activate your virtual environment:
   Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

   Launch VS Code: code .

   Install requirements (if not done yet):
   pip install -r requirements.txt

📊 Project Focus Areas
Current Workflow
✔️ Completed: Basic setup and "get started" script

🚧 In Progress:

Missing data imputation with Bayesian methods

Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with PyMC

💰 Cool Finance Project Ideas
Cryptocurrency Volatility Forecasting
Model BTC-USD price movements using stochastic volatility models. Predict extreme market movements!

Credit Risk Assessment
Build a Bayesian logistic regression to predict loan defaults with uncertainty estimates.

🏭 Manufacturing Project Ideas
Quality Control with Bayesian A/B Testing
Compare production line efficiencies with proper uncertainty quantification.

Predictive Maintenance
Model equipment failure times using Weibull distributions and sensor data.
